  <h1>How to install Mavscript<br></h1>

  <h2>Quick instructions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Unzip the archive file into any directory, i.e. into
      <span class="c1">C:\Programme</span> (Windows) or
      <span class="c1">/usr/local/share</span> (Linux). The
      expression <em>path-to-mavscript</em> then stands for
      <span class="c1">C:\Programme\mavscript</span>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Copy the file <span class=
      "c2">path-to-mavscript</span><span class=
      "c1">\INFO\desktoplinks\Mavscript.windows.lnk</span> or
      <span class="c2">path-to-mavscript</span><span class=
      "c1">/INFO/desktoplinks/Mavscript.linux.desktop</span> on the
      desktop.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Right click on the icon, choose the item <span class=
      "c3">Properties</span>. In the dialog that opens you may need
      to <strong>adjust the <em>path-to-mavscript</em>
      !</strong></p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If you haven't already, install Java (Java Runtime
      Environment 1.4 or above).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2><br></h2>

  <h2>Windows (2000, XP)</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Extract the zip file <span class=
      "c1">mavscript*.zip</span> into any directory, i.e. into
      <span class="c1">C:\Programme</span> (note: depending on the
      system language this directory might be called differently,
      i.e. <span class="c1">C:\Program Files</span>). A
      subdirectory <span class="c1">mavscript</span> will be
      created. The path-to-mavscript then is <span class=
      "c1">C:\Programme\mavscript</span>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Java (JRE) version 1.4 or higher must be installed. To
      check this, open the command prompt (DOS-window) and type
      <span class="c1">java -version</span>  . If a messeage
      appears saying java could not be found, java is not
      installed.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>In the directory <span class=
      "c1">C:\Programme\mavscript\INFO\desktoplinks</span> there is
      a file <span class="c1">Mavscript.windows.lnk</span>. Drag
      this file - while pressing the Ctrl-key - on the desktop.<br>
      Select the icon on the desktop (that has just been created),
      press the right mouse button and open the <span class=
      "c3">properties</span> dialog. In one of the tabs there is a
      command field. There should be written <span class=
      "c1">C:\Programme\mavscript\</span><span class=
      "c1">mavscript-yacas</span><span class="c1">.bat</span> . In
      the field working directory: <span class=
      "c1">C:\Programme\mavscript</span> .<br>
      Note, you might have to adjust the path-to-mavscript (i.e .
      <span class="c1">C:\Program Files</span>\<span class=
      "c1">mavscript</span>) in both fields.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Mavscript is now installed. There are example files in the
    directory <span class=
    "c1">C:\Programme\mavscript\</span><span class=
    "c1">example</span> . Drag one of it (i.e. <span class=
    "c1">1-yacas</span><span class="c1">.txt</span>) on the
    mavscript-icon on the desktop (that has been created in point
    3). A window opens and when everything works fine on the last
    line should be written "Fertig. Mavscript wird beendet.",
    saying that the calculation has been completed. The output file
    <span class="c1">out.</span><span class="c1">1-yacas.txt</span>
    has been created.<br>
    <br></li>

    <li>It is not mandatory to have installed <em>OpenOffice</em>,
    but it is useful to create formatted text. The
    OpenOffice-Writer files (suffix <span class="c1">.odt</span> or
    <span class="c1">.sxw)</span> can be used with Mavscript
    exactly the same way as text or html files. Microsoft Word
    files (suffix .doc) do not work. However if you know Word
    you'll get along with OpenOffice.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>It does not work ...</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>If mavscript doen't even start, the paht-to-mavscript might
    not be set correctly (see above).</li>

    <li>
      <p>In order to locate the error, open a DOS-window (command
      prompt) and type the following:<span class="c1"><br>
      cd \Programme\mavscript</span><br>
      <span class="c1">mavscript examples/1-yacas.txt</span></p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the input file name (or its path name) contains
      <span class="c3">space characters</span> (blanks), then the
      name has to be encapsulated by "quotation marks". The direct
      program call out of the DOS-window then looks like this:
      <span class="c1"><br>
      java -jar mavscript*.jar ./"template file with
      blanks"</span></p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>If the option --port does not work, a <span class=
      "c3">Firewall</span> might prevent Mavscript from connecting
      to the external program. If this is the case, a message in
      the Mavscript window should say that Mavscript could not
      establish the connection. Configure the firewall program,
      that is allows the connection (i.e. on port 9734).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>LINUX <span class="c1"> mavscript*.rpm</span> </h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Java (JRE) version 1.4 or higher must be installed. To
    check this open a shell and type: <span class="c1">java
    -version</span><br>
    <br></li>

    <li>Open a shell and type<br>
    <code>sudo rpm -Uvh mavscript*.rpm</code><br>
    and enter the root password.<br>

    <li>Mavscript is now installed. It can be called from any
    directory.<br>

      <span class="c1">/usr/local/share/mavscript</span>. You'll
      need to be root to write to this directory. Step by step:<br>
      Open a shell (konsole) and type<br>
