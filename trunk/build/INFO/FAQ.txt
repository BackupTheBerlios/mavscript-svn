Q: How can I use a newer/older version of Yacas?

A: In order to use a newer version, just replace the file yacas.jar in
   PATH-TO-MAVSCRIPT/lib.
   In order to downgrade do the same. Yacas 1.0.62 (and older) additionly
   require the file scripts.zip.

Q: How can I plot results with Mavscript?
A: See Advanced-HowToCreateGraphs.txt

Q: I want to use Mavscript together with LaTeX. The "$"-sign is used by both
   TeX and Mavscript. Could you please change the Mavscript control chars?

A: Call Mavscript i.e. like this: "mavscript-yacas -D %".
   This tells Mavscript to expect the control characters %m, %i, %io, %o and %n

Q: Is it possible to use Mavscript with pipes.

A: Yes, Mavscript can read from standard input (stdin) or write to standard
   output (stdout). Example:
   echo '$m nf(Pi*8^2,1) $io' | mavscript-yacas

Q: Mavscript 0.1.6 seems to run slower than previous versions.

A. Mavscript 0.1.6 includes Yacas 1.2.2. The yacas syntax has slightly changed
   since version 1.0.62 that was included in Mavscript 0.1.5.
   "If(expr1 < expr2, ...)" now is correct syntax, no need to write
   "If(N(expr1) < N(expr2), ...)" anymore.
   The decrease of speed (and potentially other problems) is related to the
   function "N(expression)". It does not evaluate the expression anymore.

   Solution: Instead of "N(expr)", use "N(Eval(expr))" or "nf(expr)".
